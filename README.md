# Meemeow's GitCafe

---

## Overview

**Meemeow's GitCafe** is a front-end web project developed during my **second year at FEU Institute of Technology** as the final requirement for the **Advanced Web Design** subject. The primary objective of the project was to design and present a visually engaging website that demonstrates front-end fundamentals, including navigation, branding, and an e-commerce–style layout.

---

## Project Background

This project focused entirely on **front-end development**, with an emphasis on layout structure, styling, and basic interactivity. The concept and theme of the website were shaped collaboratively, with my project partner **Serenity Dizon** contributing ideas and creative direction on how the website should come to life.

I took full responsibility for implementing all the code, translating those ideas into a functional website using core web technologies.

## Features & Scope

- Navigation bar with logo and branding
- E-commerce–inspired layout and structure
- Desktop-focused design
- Static front-end implementation

---

## Limitations

- ❌ Not responsive across different screen sizes and devices  
- ❌ No backend or database integration  
- ❌ Desktop-only optimization  

These limitations were acknowledged as part of the learning process, as the project scope was constrained to front-end concepts only.

---

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (basic interactivity)

---

## Reflection

Despite its limitations, **Meemeow's GitCafe** represents a meaningful milestone in my growth as a developer. As a second-year student at the time, completing a full front-end project independently was a significant achievement. This project reflects my early understanding of web structure, styling, and design principles, and serves as a foundation for the more advanced, responsive, and full-stack projects I have built since.
